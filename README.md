# Investigate a Dataset: No-show Appointments

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to conduct a thorough investigation of a medical appointment dataset collected from 100,000 patients in Brazil. The dataset contains information on various characteristics of patients, including age, gender, and neighborhood, as well as whether or not they showed up for their scheduled appointment. The primary focus of this project is to answer the question of whether there is a relationship between these patient characteristics and the likelihood of them attending their appointment. Through careful analysis and interpretation of the data, we aim to gain insights into the factors that may influence patient attendance and inform strategies for improving appointment adherence in the future.

## Objective
What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

## Exploratory
Suggested questions that promote the relationships between several variables that affect the patient to make it to his appiontment by looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable

## Conclusion
According to the dataset, the investigation has taken a closer look at four key areas of interest, including Gender, Age, SMS received, and Scholarship. The objective of the analysis is to identify which of these characteristics have the greatest impact on patient attendance, in order to enhance the medical appointment system.

## Learning Outcome

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

I have acquired knowledge of the data analysis process, including the steps of posing questions with the use of Python NumPy, accessing data through Pandas Series and DataFrame objects, and wrangling data to a desired format. Additionally, I have become proficient in investigating issues within datasets and interpreting visualizations created with Matplotlib to gain insights into the data.
